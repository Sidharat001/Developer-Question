HOC :- https://tinyurl.com/ReactHOC

Pure Component  :- https://tinyurl.com/PureComponent
A PureComponent in React is a class component that implements the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method with a shallow comparison of props and state. This optimization prevents unnecessary re-renders when the props and state haven't changed, improving performance. It is useful for components with complex state or props, ensuring updates only occur when necessary, leading to a more efficient rendering process.
